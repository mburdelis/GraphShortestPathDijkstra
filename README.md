# GraphShortestPathDijkstra
Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm Applied to a Graph with Edge List Representation

This is an implementation for C++ practice purposes. 
It is possible to specify the number of nodes of a graph, and its density.
After that two vertices are chosen and the program runs a number of simulations of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm to find the shortest path from one vertice to the other.
Graphs are implemented using the edge-list representation.
